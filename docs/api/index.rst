.. note::
    Please first review the `MediaWiki API <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page>`_ and
    `REST API <https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/>`_ to see if they meet your needs. These will be considerably
    faster than XTools and allow for asynchronous requests.

A public API is available for getting basic statistics. Below is each available endpoint.
All data is returned as JSON, in addition to other formats as noted.
